# Mitrack

Mitrack as it is right now is the result of an attept to create a unique habit tracking application. This current version is missing lots of key features that will hopefully be implimented later on 

# Installation instructions

This requires an android emulator of some sort, i recommend Noxplayer

1.) download app-debug.apk

2.) open wherever download folder resides 
it should automatically open the emulator with Mitrack installed
